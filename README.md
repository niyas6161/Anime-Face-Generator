# Anime-Face-Generator
DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) generates anime faces by training a neural network with two parts: generator and discriminator. Generator creates images from random noise, while discriminator distinguishes real from generated. Through adversarial training, generator improves to create realistic anime faces.
